# Shipping_Optimization

This repository contains the code and data for predicting shipping times in the context of logistics and transportation.

## Overview

This project aims to predict shipping times for different shipments using regression models. It includes historical shipment data, code for model training, and evaluation.

## Contents

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for model training and testing.
- `models/`: Includes trained models for predicting shipping times.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Video Demo


Uploading Mugure_Benson_s2038770_Big_Data_CW2.mp4â€¦


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with necessary libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
Use scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess the dataset.

### Model Training
Run the training scripts to build regression models.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using provided evaluation scripts.

## Model Selection

The repository contains implementations of various regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Network (NN)
- Bayesian Ridge
